<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage Examples

### Usage: Bookmaker using for pricing specific lines of players, teams, etc.

###### Application:
###### Creation of new indicators outside the standard provided by the site. Possibility of historical side-by-side comparison not available with standard tables.
###### These possibilities, and others that can be discovered with a more in-depth study of the Data Frame, will help the company's strategy for better pricing.

### Usage: Professional bettors using the data to take advantage of 'wrong' pricing by bookmakers.

###### Application:
###### By analyzing and studying the Data Frame, professional bettors can come to the conclusion of what would be a fair price line for the specific situation based on historical data. Once the fair price has been defined, he can research bookmakers and take advantage of the leverage of a distorted pricing line.

### Usage: Machine Learning algorithms to find the correct price for both bookmakers and professional bettors.

###### Application:
###### The data from the Data Frame can also be used by Machine Learning algorithms for training and generating an automated pricing for each line in the present based on historical data. Thus, if it is used by bookmakers, it can reduce the chance of distorted pricing and increase profits, or the algorithm can be used by professional bettors to take advantage of the bookmaker's mistake and leverage their profit in the event of distorted pricing.
